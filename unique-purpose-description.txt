=== Unique Purpose ===

URL Block provides intelligent phishing protection through a sophisticated dual-filtering system that goes beyond simple blocklists. Unlike generic ad blockers or basic URL filters, this extension features:

**Three-Mode Protection System:**
- BLOCK: Dangerous sites are completely blocked
- WARN: Suspicious sites show warnings but allow access
- ALLOW: Safe sites load normally

**Smart Pattern Matching:**
- Domain-aware filtering (zoom.us blocks fakezoom.us but allows subdomain.zoom.us)
- Wildcard patterns for flexible threat detection
- Pre-configured protection against character substitution, typosquatting, and Unicode attacks

**Dual-List Intelligence:**
Sites appearing on both blacklist and whitelist trigger non-blocking warnings instead of complete blocks, allowing users to make informed decisions about potentially legitimate but flagged sites.

**Focus on Evolving Threats:**
Specifically targets modern phishing techniques including Cyrillic character substitution (gооgle.com), number substitution (g00gle.com), and domain typosquatting (zooom.us) that traditional blockers miss.

This targeted approach provides more nuanced protection than binary allow/deny systems, making security decisions contextual rather than absolute.
