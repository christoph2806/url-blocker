=== Unique Purpose (Concise) ===

URL Block offers intelligent three-mode phishing protection (Block/Warn/Allow) with smart pattern matching that distinguishes between malicious sites and legitimate subdomains. 

Unlike basic blockers, it features:
- Domain-aware filtering (blocks fakezoom.us, allows subdomain.zoom.us)
- Dual-list system providing contextual warnings instead of binary blocking
- Pre-configured protection against modern threats (character substitution, typosquatting, Unicode attacks)
- Non-blocking warnings for sites on both lists, enabling informed user decisions

This targeted approach provides nuanced security decisions rather than absolute allow/deny, specifically designed for evolving phishing techniques that traditional blockers miss.
