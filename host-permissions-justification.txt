HOST PERMISSIONS JUSTIFICATION
For Chrome Web Store submission:

=== host_permissions: <all_urls> ===

This extension requires access to all URLs to provide comprehensive phishing protection. Malicious actors continuously create fraudulent websites using:

1. Character substitution (g00gle.com, amaz0n.com)
2. Typosquatting (zooom.us, googlle.com) 
3. Unicode attacks (using Cyrillic characters)
4. Subdomain spoofing (secure-paypal.fake-site.com)
5. New malicious domains appearing daily

These attacks can occur on ANY domain across the entire web. Restricting this extension to specific domains would create security gaps that attackers could exploit. The <all_urls> permission enables real-time protection by:

- Monitoring navigation to check URLs against blacklist patterns
- Injecting content scripts to display warnings on suspicious sites
- Redirecting users away from confirmed malicious websites
- Providing consistent protection regardless of where threats appear

This broad permission is essential for effective security - phishing protection cannot be limited to predetermined websites when threats emerge on new domains constantly. All processing occurs locally; no data is transmitted to external servers.
